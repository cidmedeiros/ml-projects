\subsection{Project: Creating Customer
Segments}\label{project-creating-customer-segments}

    Welcome to the third project of the Machine Learning Engineer
Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been
provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional
functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections
that begin with \textbf{'Implementation'} in the header indicate that
the following block of code will require additional functionality which
you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the
specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}TODO\textquotesingle{}} statement. Please be
sure to read the instructions carefully!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must
answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section
where you will answer a question is preceded by a \textbf{'Question X'}
header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the
following text boxes that begin with \textbf{'Answer:'}. Your project
submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the
questions and the implementation you provide.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Note:} Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the
\textbf{Shift + Enter} keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells
can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

    \subsection{Getting Started}\label{getting-started}

In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various
customers' annual spending amounts (reported in \emph{monetary units})
of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this
project is to best describe the variation in the different types of
customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would
equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their
delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

The dataset for this project can be found on the
\href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers}{UCI
Machine Learning Repository}. For the purposes of this project, the
features \texttt{\textquotesingle{}Channel\textquotesingle{}} and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}Region\textquotesingle{}} will be excluded in
the analysis --- with focus instead on the six product categories
recorded for customers.

Run the code block below to load the wholesale customers dataset, along
with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project.
You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset
is reported.

    \subsection{Data Exploration}\label{data-exploration}

In this section, you will begin exploring the data through
visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the
others. You will observe a statistical description of the dataset,
consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data
points from the dataset which you will track through the course of this
project.

Run the code block below to observe a statistical description of the
dataset. Note that the dataset is composed of six important product
categories: \textbf{'Fresh'}, \textbf{'Milk'}, \textbf{'Grocery'},
\textbf{'Frozen'}, \textbf{'Detergents\_Paper'}, and
\textbf{'Delicatessen'}. Consider what each category represents in terms
of products you could purchase.

    \subsubsection{Implementation: Selecting
Samples}\label{implementation-selecting-samples}

To get a better understanding of the customers and how their data will
transform through the analysis, it would be best to select a few sample
data points and explore them in more detail. In the code block below,
add \textbf{three} indices of your choice to the \texttt{indices} list
which will represent the customers to track. It is suggested to try
different sets of samples until you obtain customers that vary
significantly from one another.

    \subsubsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

Consider the total purchase cost of each product category and the
statistical description of the dataset above for your sample customers.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples
  you've chosen represent?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hint:} Examples of establishments include places like markets,
cafes, delis, wholesale retailers, among many others. Avoid using names
for establishments, such as saying \emph{"McDonalds"} when describing a
sample customer as a restaurant. You can use the mean values for
reference to compare your samples with. The mean values are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Fresh: 12000.2977
\item
  Milk: 5796.2
\item
  Grocery: 7951.3
\item
  Detergents\_paper: 2881.4
\item
  Delicatessen: 1524.8
\end{itemize}

Knowing this, how do your samples compare? Does that help in driving
your insight into what kind of establishments they might be?

    \textbf{Answer:}

I would expect markets to be establishments where the spending on Fresh
products will be higher than the mean, as well as higher than any other
product category. The first and the fourth sample filled in that
expectation, so I would argue that these two samples are markets
establishments.

I imagine cafes as the kind of establishments where milk would play a
major role in cooking baked goods. With that in mind, the milk's
spending for the second sample really stands out, so I would label it as
a cafe.

The third sample doesn't hold any particular pattern on its spendings,
they were all similar and below the mean. Therefore, I think this might
be a general-goods oriented small around the corner retailer.

Comparing specific observations values against measures of central
tendency indeed helps to get a more informed sense about where these
observations might be located in the overall classes of the dataset.

    \subsubsection{Implementation: Feature
Relevance}\label{implementation-feature-relevance}

One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six
product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer
purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether
customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will
necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of
products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a
supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature
removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed
feature.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: -
Assign \texttt{new\_data} a copy of the data by removing a feature of
your choice using the \texttt{DataFrame.drop} function. - Use
\texttt{sklearn.cross\_validation.train\_test\_split} to split the
dataset into training and testing sets. - Use the removed feature as
your target label. Set a \texttt{test\_size} of \texttt{0.25} and set a
\texttt{random\_state}. - Import a decision tree regressor, set a
\texttt{random\_state}, and fit the learner to the training data. -
Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's
\texttt{score} function.

    \subsubsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Which feature did you attempt to predict?
\item
  What was the reported prediction score?
\item
  Is this feature necessary for identifying customers' spending habits?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hint:} The coefficient of determination, \texttt{R\^{}2}, is
scored between 0 and 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. A negative
\texttt{R\^{}2} implies the model fails to fit the data. If you get a
low score for a particular feature, that lends us to believe that that
feature point is hard to predict using the other features, thereby
making it an important feature to consider when considering relevance.

    \textbf{Answer:}

I tried to predict the Milk feature. The reported score for it was
0.15627539501732116. It's quite a low score which indicates this feature
holds a high relevance in understanding and making predictions for the
data.

    \subsubsection{Visualize Feature
Distributions}\label{visualize-feature-distributions}

To get a better understanding of the dataset, we can construct a scatter
matrix of each of the six product features present in the data. If you
found that the feature you attempted to predict above is relevant for
identifying a specific customer, then the scatter matrix below may not
show any correlation between that feature and the others. Conversely, if
you believe that feature is not relevant for identifying a specific
customer, the scatter matrix might show a correlation between that
feature and another feature in the data. Run the code block below to
produce a scatter matrix.

    \subsubsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Using the scatter matrix as a reference, discuss the distribution of
  the dataset, specifically talk about the normality, outliers, large
  number of data points near 0 among others. If you need to separate out
  some of the plots individually to further accentuate your point, you
  may do so as well.
\item
  Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of
  correlation?
\item
  Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the
  feature you attempted to predict?
\item
  How is the data for those features distributed?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hint:} Is the data normally distributed? Where do most of the
data points lie? You can use
\href{https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html}{corr()}
to get the feature correlations and then visualize them using a
\href{http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html}{heatmap}(the
data that would be fed into the heatmap would be the correlation values,
for eg: \texttt{data.corr()}) to gain further insight.

    \textbf{Answer:}

Some pairs of features display a correlation between them. The pair
Grocery\Milk have a Pearson correlation of 0.728335, while
Grocery\Detergents\_Paper pair's Pearson correlation is as high as
0.924641. The Delicatessen feature is the one with the smallest Pearson
correlation in any pair it forms with.

The Pearson correlation for the pair Milk\Detergents\_Paper is the third
highest. Adding that up to the low R\^{}2 score for Milk calculated
before, the present scenario confirms my suspicion about how variance
and feature importance are related.

All the features display right-skewed distributions with the majority of
observations close to the minimum values in each series and just a few
data points stand out with more higher values, which might indicate that
most of the establishments have roughly the same products availability.
There are some notorious outliers regarding the Frozen and Delicatessen
features.

    \subsection{Data Preprocessing}\label{data-preprocessing}

In this section, you will preprocess the data to create a better
representation of customers by performing a scaling on the data and
detecting (and optionally removing) outliers. Preprocessing data is
often times a critical step in assuring that results you obtain from
your analysis are significant and meaningful.

    \subsubsection{Implementation: Feature
Scaling}\label{implementation-feature-scaling}

If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median
vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most
\href{http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics}{often
appropriate} to apply a non-linear scaling --- particularly for
financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a
\href{http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html}{Box-Cox
test}, which calculates the best power transformation of the data that
reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would
be applying the natural logarithm.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: -
Assign a copy of the data to \texttt{log\_data} after applying
logarithmic scaling. Use the \texttt{np.log} function for this. - Assign
a copy of the sample data to \texttt{log\_samples} after applying
logarithmic scaling. Again, use \texttt{np.log}.

    \subsubsection{Observation}\label{observation}

After applying a natural logarithm scaling to the data, the distribution
of each feature should appear much more normal. For any pairs of
features you may have identified earlier as being correlated, observe
here whether that correlation is still present (and whether it is now
stronger or weaker than before).

Run the code below to see how the sample data has changed after having
the natural logarithm applied to it.

    \subsubsection{Implementation: Outlier
Detection}\label{implementation-outlier-detection}

Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data
preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often
skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are
many "rules of thumb" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset.
Here, we will use
\href{http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/}{Tukey's
Method for identfying outliers}: An \emph{outlier step} is calculated as
1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature
that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is
considered abnormal.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: -
Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to
\texttt{Q1}. Use \texttt{np.percentile} for this. - Assign the value of
the 75th percentile for the given feature to \texttt{Q3}. Again, use
\texttt{np.percentile}. - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for
the given feature to \texttt{step}. - Optionally remove data points from
the dataset by adding indices to the \texttt{outliers} list.

\textbf{NOTE:} If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the
sample data does not contain any of these points!\\
Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored
in the variable \texttt{good\_data}.

    \subsubsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Are there any data points considered outliers for more than one
  feature based on the definition above?
\item
  Should these data points be removed from the dataset?
\item
  If any data points were added to the \texttt{outliers} list to be
  removed, explain why.
\end{itemize}

** Hint: ** If you have datapoints that are outliers in multiple
categories think about why that may be and if they warrant removal. Also
note how k-means is affected by outliers and whether or not this plays a
factor in your analysis of whether or not to remove them.

    \textbf{Answer:}

All the features in the original data are bearing outliers according to
the Tukey's Method for detecting outliers. Fresh is the feature with the
most outliers, being that 16 data points in total.

All the outliers are located in regions far from the center of the
bell-shaped distribution, therefore, these data points should be
removed. I have dropped all detected outliers. Dropping these data
points will result in more normal data distributions, making the results
more robust and less noisy.

    \subsection{Feature Transformation}\label{feature-transformation}

In this section you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to draw
conclusions about the underlying structure of the wholesale customer
data. Since using PCA on a dataset calculates the dimensions which best
maximize variance, we will find which compound combinations of features
best describe customers.

    \subsubsection{Implementation: PCA}\label{implementation-pca}

Now that the data has been scaled to a more normal distribution and has
had any necessary outliers removed, we can now apply PCA to the
\texttt{good\_data} to discover which dimensions about the data best
maximize the variance of features involved. In addition to finding these
dimensions, PCA will also report the \emph{explained variance ratio} of
each dimension --- how much variance within the data is explained by
that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be
considered a new "feature" of the space, however it is a composition of
the original features present in the data.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: -
Import \texttt{sklearn.decomposition.PCA} and assign the results of
fitting PCA in six dimensions with \texttt{good\_data} to \texttt{pca}.
- Apply a PCA transformation of \texttt{log\_samples} using
\texttt{pca.transform}, and assign the results to \texttt{pca\_samples}.

    \subsubsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How much variance in the data is explained* \textbf{in total} *by the
  first and second principal component?
\item
  How much variance in the data is explained by the first four principal
  components?
\item
  Using the visualization provided above, talk about each dimension and
  the cumulative variance explained by each, stressing upon which
  features are well represented by each dimension(both in terms of
  positive and negative variance explained). Discuss what the first four
  dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hint:} A positive increase in a specific dimension corresponds
with an \emph{increase} of the \emph{positive-weighted} features and a
\emph{decrease} of the \emph{negative-weighted} features. The rate of
increase or decrease is based on the individual feature weights.

    \textbf{Answer:}

n total, the first two components explain 59.6\%‬ of the variance in the
data. In total, the first four components explain 76.2\%‬ of the
variance in the data.

The first dimension accounts for 41\% of the variance mostly due to
Grocery, Detergents\_Paper, and Milk. It's not a coincidence that these
three features have the highest correlation coefficient between them as
they ended up contributing the most for the principal component of the
data. What this dimension is telling us is that establishments selling
grocery are also meeting their customers' demand for detergents and
milk.

The second dimension

    \subsubsection{Observation}\label{observation}

Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has
changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it in six
dimensions. Observe the numerical value for the first four dimensions of
the sample points. Consider if this is consistent with your initial
interpretation of the sample points.

\end{Verbatim}


    \subsubsection{Implementation: Dimensionality
Reduction}\label{implementation-dimensionality-reduction}

When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to
reduce the dimensionality of the data --- in effect, reducing the
complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost:
Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is
being explained. Because of this, the \emph{cumulative explained
variance ratio} is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions
are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of
variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data
can be visualized afterwards.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: -
Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with
\texttt{good\_data} to \texttt{pca}. - Apply a PCA transformation of
\texttt{good\_data} using \texttt{pca.transform}, and assign the results
to \texttt{reduced\_data}. - Apply a PCA transformation of
\texttt{log\_samples} using \texttt{pca.transform}, and assign the
results to \texttt{pca\_samples}.

\end{Verbatim}


    \subsubsection{Observation}\label{observation}

Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has
changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it using only two
dimensions. Observe how the values for the first two dimensions remains
unchanged when compared to a PCA transformation in six dimensions.

\end{Verbatim}


    \subsection{Visualizing a Biplot}\label{visualizing-a-biplot}

A biplot is a scatterplot where each data point is represented by its
scores along the principal components. The axes are the principal
components (in this case \texttt{Dimension\ 1} and
\texttt{Dimension\ 2}). In addition, the biplot shows the projection of
the original features along the components. A biplot can help us
interpret the reduced dimensions of the data, and discover relationships
between the principal components and original features.

Run the code cell below to produce a biplot of the reduced-dimension
data.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor} }]:} \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} Create a biplot}
        \PY{n}{vs}\PY{o}{.}\PY{n}{biplot}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{good\PYZus{}data}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{reduced\PYZus{}data}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{pca}\PY{p}{)}
\end{Verbatim}


    \subsubsection{Observation}\label{observation}

Once we have the original feature projections (in red), it is easier to
interpret the relative position of each data point in the scatterplot.
For instance, a point the lower right corner of the figure will likely
correspond to a customer that spends a lot on
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}Milk\textquotesingle{}},
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}Grocery\textquotesingle{}} and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}Detergents\_Paper\textquotesingle{}}, but not
so much on the other product categories.

From the biplot, which of the original features are most strongly
correlated with the first component? What about those that are
associated with the second component? Do these observations agree with
the pca\_results plot you obtained earlier?

    \subsection{Clustering}\label{clustering}

In this section, you will choose to use either a K-Means clustering
algorithm or a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify
the various customer segments hidden in the data. You will then recover
specific data points from the clusters to understand their significance
by transforming them back into their original dimension and scale.

    \subsubsection{Question 6}\label{question-6}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm?
\item
  What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering
  algorithm?
\item
  Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far,
  which of the two algorithms will you use and why?
\end{itemize}

** Hint: ** Think about the differences between hard clustering and soft
clustering and which would be appropriate for our dataset.

    \textbf{Answer:}

    \subsubsection{Implementation: Creating
Clusters}\label{implementation-creating-clusters}

Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be
in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not
known \emph{a priori}, there is no guarantee that a given number of
clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure
exists in the data --- if any. However, we can quantify the "goodness"
of a clustering by calculating each data point's \emph{silhouette
coefficient}. The
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html}{silhouette
coefficient} for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned
cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the \emph{mean}
silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given
clustering.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: - Fit
a clustering algorithm to the \texttt{reduced\_data} and assign it to
\texttt{clusterer}. - Predict the cluster for each data point in
\texttt{reduced\_data} using \texttt{clusterer.predict} and assign them
to \texttt{preds}. - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's
respective attribute and assign them to \texttt{centers}. - Predict the
cluster for each sample data point in \texttt{pca\_samples} and assign
them \texttt{sample\_preds}. - Import
\texttt{sklearn.metrics.silhouette\_score} and calculate the silhouette
score of \texttt{reduced\_data} against \texttt{preds}. - Assign the
silhouette score to \texttt{score} and print the result.

    \subsubsection{Question 7}\label{question-7}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried.
\item
  Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score?
\end{itemize}

    \textbf{Answer:}

    \subsubsection{Cluster Visualization}\label{cluster-visualization}

Once you've chosen the optimal number of clusters for your clustering
algorithm using the scoring metric above, you can now visualize the
results by executing the code block below. Note that, for
experimentation purposes, you are welcome to adjust the number of
clusters for your clustering algorithm to see various visualizations.
The final visualization provided should, however, correspond with the
optimal number of clusters.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\end{Verbatim}


    \subsubsection{Implementation: Data
Recovery}\label{implementation-data-recovery}

Each cluster present in the visualization above has a central point.
These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data,
but rather the \emph{averages} of all the data points predicted in the
respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a
cluster's center point corresponds to \emph{the average customer of that
segment}. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by
a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from
these data points by applying the inverse transformations.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: -
Apply the inverse transform to \texttt{centers} using
\texttt{pca.inverse\_transform} and assign the new centers to
\texttt{log\_centers}. - Apply the inverse function of \texttt{np.log}
to \texttt{log\_centers} using \texttt{np.exp} and assign the true
centers to \texttt{true\_centers}.

    \subsubsection{Question 8}\label{question-8}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Consider the total purchase cost of each product category for the
  representative data points above, and reference the statistical
  description of the dataset at the beginning of this
  project(specifically looking at the mean values for the various
  feature points). What set of establishments could each of the customer
  segments represent?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hint:} A customer who is assigned to
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}Cluster\ X\textquotesingle{}} should best
identify with the establishments represented by the feature set of
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}Segment\ X\textquotesingle{}}. Think about
what each segment represents in terms their values for the feature
points chosen. Reference these values with the mean values to get some
perspective into what kind of establishment they represent.

\item
  For each sample point, which customer segment from* \textbf{Question

\end{Verbatim}


    \textbf{Answer:}

    \subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

    In this final section, you will investigate ways that you can make use
of the clustered data. First, you will consider how the different groups
of customers, the \textbf{\emph{customer segments}}, may be affected
differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how
giving a label to each customer (which \emph{segment} that customer
belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data.
Finally, you will compare the \textbf{\emph{customer segments}} to a
hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering
identified certain relationships.

    \subsubsection{Question 10}\label{question-10}

Companies will often run
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing}{A/B tests} when making
small changes to their products or services to determine whether making
that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The
wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from
currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will
only make this change in delivery service for customers that react
positively.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to
  determine which customers, if any, would react positively to the
  change in delivery service?*
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hint:} Can we assume the change affects all customers equally?
How can we determine which group of customers it affects the most?

    \subsubsection{Question 11}\label{question-11}

Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when
using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a
\textbf{\emph{customer segment}} it best identifies with (depending on
the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider \emph{'customer
segment'} as an \textbf{engineered feature} for the data. Assume the
wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each
provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product
category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to
classify each new customer to a \textbf{\emph{customer segment}} to
determine the most appropriate delivery service.\\
* How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only
their estimated product spending and the \textbf{customer segment} data?

\textbf{Hint:} A supervised learner could be used to train on the
original customers. What would be the target variable?

    \subsubsection{Visualizing Underlying
Distributions}\label{visualizing-underlying-distributions}

At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}Channel\textquotesingle{}} and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}Region\textquotesingle{}} features would be
excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were
emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}Channel\textquotesingle{}} feature to the
dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA
dimensionality reduction applied earlier to the original dataset.

Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}HoReCa\textquotesingle{}}
(Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}Retail\textquotesingle{}} the reduced space.
In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot,
which will identify their labeling.

    \subsubsection{Question 12}\label{question-12}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've
  chosen compare to this underlying distribution of
  Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers?
\item
  Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely
  'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution?
\item
  Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your
  previous definition of the customer segments?
\end{itemize}
